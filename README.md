# NCPA for Adaptive Optics - Extremely Large Telescope
Adaptive Optics End-to-End simulations with COMPASS and ADOPT to simulate Non-Common-Path-Aberrations (NCPA) for a Pyramid WavefrontSensor.

Scripts written in PYTHON - Communication with COMPASS through ADOPT

- ELT Adaptive Optics End-to-End simulation thanks to COMPASS
